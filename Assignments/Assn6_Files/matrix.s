# A in %rdi, C in %rsi, N in %edx

# Using A and C as pointers

# This function is not a "caller", i.e., it does not call functions. 
# It is a leaf function (a callee). 
# Hence it does not have the responsibility of saving "caller-saved" registers 
# such as %rax, %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8 and %r9.
# This signifies that it can use these registers without 
# first saving their content if it needs to use registers.

# Set up registers
    xorl %eax, %eax            # set %eax to 0
    xorl %ecx, %ecx            # i = 0 (row index i is in %ecx)

# For each row
rowLoop:
    xorl %r8d, %r8d            # j = 0 (column index j in %r8d)
    cmpl %edx, %ecx            # while i < N (i - N < 0)
    jge doneWithRows

# For each cell of this row
colLoop:
    cmpl %edx, %r8d            # while j < N (j - N < 0)
    jge doneWithCells

# Copy the element A points to (%rdi) to the cell C points to (%rsi)
    movb (%rdi), %r9b          # temp = element A points to
    movb %r9b, (%rsi)          # cell C points to = temp

# Update A and C so they now point to their next element 
    incq %rdi
    incq %rsi

    incl %r8d                  # j++ (column index in %r8d)
    jmp colLoop                # go to next cell

# Go to next row
doneWithCells:
    incl %ecx                  # i++ (row index in %ecx)
    jmp rowLoop                # go to next row
